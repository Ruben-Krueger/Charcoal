# To Do
- [ ] Give JS version feature parity (also make it work first)
- [ ] `Execute` operator
- [ ] Shorter `getvar`/`evalvar`/`execvar`
- [ ] Examples for PPCG questions 4, 7
- [ ] Decide whether to add roll (shift string right (and maybe left))?, 
translate and more complex number things e.g. factor
